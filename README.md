### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, not _the-lover_). I am trained as an electrical engineer and a (lapsed) System Biologist (Neuroscientist). 
You can find my brief history [here](https://dilawars.notion.site/A-brief-history-of-Dilawar-7e28486f832a4f59905899d7d318f287).

I am passionate about Operating Systems, ML at the Edge, Observability and Security (eBPF, etc.), and low-level system programming in general. 
These days, I mostly use Rust, C/C++, PHP, and Python, and occasionally Haskell and Nim.
