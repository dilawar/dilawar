### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were or the-lover). I am trained as an electrical engineer and a System Biologist (Neuroscientist). 
You can find my brief history [here](https://dilawars.notion.site/A-brief-history-of-Dilawar-7e28486f832a4f59905899d7d318f287).

Currently, I am busy with my startup Subconscious Compute that leverages bio-inspired approximate computations
to detect and classify "patterns". 

We are hiring! If you are passionate about Operating Systems, ML at the Edge, 
Observability and Security (eBPF etc.), and low-level system programming in general, 
drop me an email. We mostly use Rust, C/C++, PHP, and Python, and occassionaly Haskell and Nim.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on endpoint security (for work) and DevOps for BioInformatics (for fun).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows OS 😞 (for work), and cell biology (for fun).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning at the Edge, observability and security (for work 👷‍♂️); and on neuroscience, cell biology for fun 🏏. 
- 💬 Ask me about computations in the cells and neurons, living machines, and unix command line.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop an email to <dilawar.s.rajput@gmail.com>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can run 10km🏃‍♂️ easily now. It was the only item on my bucket list! In fact, I even ran a half-marathon!!
