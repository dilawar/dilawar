### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, the-lover).

I am an electrical engineer (M.Tech, Ph.D. withdrawn) and a PhD in System Biology/Neuroscience.

Currently, I am busy with my startup Subconscious Compute that leverages bio-inspired approximate computations
to detects "patterns" quickly. We are hiring! If you are passionate about Operating Systems, ML at the Edge, 
Observability and Security (eBPF etc.), and low-level system programming in general, 
drop me an email. We mostly use C/C++ and occassionaly Rust and nim.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on endpoint security (for work) and particle/neural simulators (for fun).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows OS 😞 (for work), and cell biology (for fun).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning at the Edge, observability and security (for work 👷‍♂️); and on neuroscience, cell biology for fun 🏏. 
- 💬 Ask me about computations in the brain, and unix command line.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop an email to <dilawar.s.rajput@gmail.com>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can run 10km🏃‍♂️ easily now. It was the only item on my bucket list!
