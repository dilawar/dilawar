### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, not _the-lover_). I build systems (web and application).
I am [a generalist](https://dilawars.notion.site/Generalist-148e579bff89805e86b3f4f2d8b73973) system engineer -- who thrives in strucured environment well
suited for early to mid stage startups and fast moving small teams. I also take specliased projects on data-to-decision computations. 

I was trained as an electrical engineer and a (lapsed) System Biologist (Neuroscientist). 
You can find my brief history [here](https://dilawars.notion.site/A-brief-history-of-Dilawar-7e28486f832a4f59905899d7d318f287).

I've been writing SaaS and data platforms, security solutions,kernel components, APIs. I enjoy working with Operating Systems, ML at the Edge, Observability and endpoint Security (minifilter, eBPF, etc.), and 
low-level system programming in general. 

These days, I mostly use Rust, C/C++, PHP, Python, and TS/JS and occasionally Haskell and Nim.
