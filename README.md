### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, the-lover). I am an electrical engineer (Master of Tech, Ph.D. withdrawn)
and a system biologist (Ph.D.).

These days I am working on my startup Subconscious Compute that leverage bio-inspired approximate computations
to find patterns quickly (mouthful 🙄). 

We are hiring! If you are passionate about Operating Systems, Observability and Security (eBPF etc.), and other low-level system programming stuff,
drop me an email. We mostly use C/C++, Rust, nim; and I hate Java (well who doesn't).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on endpoint cybersecurity (for work) and particle/neural simulators (for fun).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows OS 😞 (for work), and cell biology 🌛 (for fun).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning at the edge, observability and security (for work) and on neuroscience, cell biology for fun. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Windows 🦖 and logos for my startup.
- 💬 Ask me about computations in the brain, and unix command line.
- 📫 How to reach me: <dilawar.s.rajput@gmail.com?
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can run 10km🏃‍♂️ easily now. It was the only item on my bucket list!
