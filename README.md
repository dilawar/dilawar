### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, not _the-lover_). I am trained as an electrical engineer and a (lapsed) System Biologist (Neuroscientist). 
You can find my brief history [here](https://dilawars.notion.site/A-brief-history-of-Dilawar-7e28486f832a4f59905899d7d318f287).

I am passionate about Operating Systems, ML at the Edge, Observability and Security (eBPF, etc.), and low-level system programming in general. 
These days, I mostly use Rust, C/C++, PHP, and Python, and occasionally Haskell and Nim.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on endpoint security (for work) and nothing else (for fun).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows OS 😞 (for work), and nothing else (for fun).
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning at the Edge, observability, and security (for work 👷‍♂️) and neuroscience and cell biology (for fun 🏏. 
- 💬 Ask me about computations in the cells and neurons, living machines, and the unix command line.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop an email to <dilawar.s.rajput@gmail.com>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can run 10km🏃‍♂️ easily now. It was the only item on my bucket list! I even ran a half-marathon!!
