### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, the-lover). I am an electrical engineer (M.Tech, Ph.D. withdrawn)
and a system biologist (PhD).

Currently, I am working on my startup Subconscious Compute that leverage bio-inspired approximate computations
to find patterns quickly (mouthful 🙄). 

We are hiring! If you are passionate about Operating Systems, Observability and Security (eBPF etc.), and 
other low-level system programming stuff, drop me an email. Don't send me your resume, send me your Github profile. 
We mostly use C/C++ and occassionaly Rust and nim.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on endpoint cybersecurity (for work) and particle/neural simulators (for fun).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows OS 😞 (for work), and cell biology 🌛 (for fun).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning at the edge, observability and security (for work 👷‍♂️); and on neuroscience, cell biology for fun 🏏. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Windows OS 🦖, and my startup (hiring).
- 💬 Ask me about computations in the brain, and unix command line.
- 📫 How to reach me: <dilawar.s.rajput@gmail.com>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can run 10km🏃‍♂️ easily now. It was the only item on my bucket list!
