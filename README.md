### Hi there 👋

I am Dilawar (pronounced the-law-were, the-lover). I am an electrical engineer and a system biologist.

These days I am working on my startup Subconscious Compute. We are hiring! If you are passionate about
Operating Systems, Observability and Security (eBPF etc.), and other low-level system programming stuff,
drop me an email. We mostly use C/C++, Rust, nim, and we hate Java! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on endpoint cybersecurity and particile simulators.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows OS 😞, and cell biology 🌛.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning at the edge, observability and security. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Windows 🦖.
- 💬 Ask me about computation in the brain.
- 📫 How to reach me: <dilawar.s.rajput@gmail.com?
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can run 10km 🏃‍♂️ easily now, it is a big deal for me!
